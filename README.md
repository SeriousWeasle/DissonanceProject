# Dissonance Project
Another Doom mod I will most likely never fully finish

# About
I made this project in the same way as weaslesstuff was created, but now with more knowledge about programming, making sprites and modelling. I hope to create the resources for this project myself this time.
It is named Dissonance Project, because I will add random stuff, regardless wether or not it fits in with the rest of the stuff.

Will this mod be balanced? No. Definitely not, this is just me working out random ideas regardless of how good they work/are balanced.
